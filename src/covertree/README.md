Cover Tree
==========

Java implementation of a cover tree for clustering on large data sets.

This class provides a Java version of the cover tree nearest neighbor algorithm.
It is based on Thomas Kollar's version of "Cover Trees for Nearest Neighbor" by 
Langford, Kakade, Beygelzimer (2007). The original algorithm is extended towards
selecting K centers which are maximally different from one another from an online sample.
